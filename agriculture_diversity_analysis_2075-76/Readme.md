# Assessing hygienic behavior in Apis mellifera liguistica in terai and mid-hill conditions for healthy colony management

- From Hygienic behaviour data (taken in Chitwan and Lalitpur. Apis mellifera in Chitwan and Lalitpur, and Apis cerana in Lalitpur only):

	- Compare Apis mellifera of Chitwan and Lalitpur. 

	- Compare Apis mellifera and Apis cerana of Lalitpur. Hygienic behaviour is quantified according to Uncapping and removing fastness.

- From net pollination data, draw an scatterplot/boxplot whichever seems appropriate (Showing relation between distance (100m, 500m, 1000m) with number of Pods, number of flowers and number of seed)

- From species diversity data, construct jacquard diagram

- Analyse hygine behaviour dataset in appropriate design

- Analyse pollination net dataset in appropriate design (probably 3 factorial rcbd)

# Methodologies

Methodologies as per each individual parameter are discussed below: 
Parameter 1: DEAD Brood removal period
Assumption: Honey bee colony removing dead brood earlier is considered more hygienic. 
100 capped broods will be pinned and the removal of dead brood will be counted in 24, 48 and 72 hours. Photograph method will be used to quantify the number. 
Parameter 2: Removal of colony debris at the bottom board 
Assumption: Colony with more debris at the bottom board is more hygienic
White paper will be placed at the bottom board. Weight of the colony debris in the white paper will be taken at every three days interval. Separate weighing of the remaining debris will be taken for the type of the wastes (separation of different wastes) and also the number of dead mites will be counted. 
Parameter 3: Distance of colony waste removal  
Assumption: The farther the bee colony removes the colony debris, more hygienic they are.
The colony debris is removed by carrying them in front of hive entrance. The removing distance will be analyzed by fixing graduated white sheet (25 cm, 100 cm, 200 cm and more) outside the hive.
Parameter 4: Number of guard bees
Assumption: Healthy colony will have more number of guard bees.
Guard bees will be counted for five minutes during three times a day at an hour interval. Observation will be taken on each peak foraging and dearth period.
Parameter 5: Number of mummified cell 
Assumption: Hygienic colony will have more number of mummified cells. 
Honeybees mummified the diseased or parasitized brood cell to avoid the spread of pathogens. The number of mummified cell will be counted monthly throughout the year.
Parameter 6: Number of different types of honeybee cells (brood, pollen, honey and vacant cell) inside the colony will be counted using 1-cm wide square grid frame. 
Parameter 7: Amount of honey collected will be weighed. 
Assumption: Hygienic colony will have good quality honey production.
During the honey flow season, honey will be collected and based on the higher honey production, the best performing high honey yielding colony will be identified.
